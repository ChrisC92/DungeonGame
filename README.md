DungeonGame

This is a main exercise taken from MOOC Object Oriented Programming With Java course.

A text based game that works in terminal.

The player is in a dungeon with a set number of vampires and a lamp that flickers when the player is not moving.

The player can move as many steps as they like but the light will only flicker when they stop.

With each step from the player the vampires also move randomly.

If the player comes into contact at any point with a vampire then the vampires is killed.

The game ends when either the lamp runs out or there are no more vampires in the dungeon.

Through the main class the parameters for the dungeons size, amount of vampires, how many moves and also whether the 
vampires have the vampires have the ability to move.
